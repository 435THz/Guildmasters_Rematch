# Guildmaster's Rematch
This is a Release Candidate mod for PMDO that allows players to rematch the game's final boss.
The boss will be scaled up to your team member with the highest level and will also gain more
bonus points on its stats the higher level it is.

To fight the boss, simply interact with the top portion of Guildmaster Summit while you have at
least 1 Revival Orb, even if only in Storage. The orb wiill be consumed if you start the fight.
Defeating the boss will grant a Glittery Apricorn, but the boss will become permanently stronger.
